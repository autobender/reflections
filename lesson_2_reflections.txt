qa  What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository you make a workspace. You need to do it so that git know where to commit the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area differs that it  exists to be commitable. You only bring things to the staging area once you are ready to commit it. While the working directory might have many files that are still under work. Which are not ready to be commited. It helps so that you can do commits over different stages.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
If you use the git diff --staged function you can check what the differences are between the staging area and the repo. One final check before commiting.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would be helpful in situations where you are trying something experimental. Or if you have different versions of a program.
If you have have a version of software that is a free trial you can make it a different branch, while the full version is another branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams can help by making visually showing what we are trying
to do. It is easy to get confused when thinking about multiple
branches. Especially if you have many commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The result is that you can combine different branchs. If you had for example a new feature ready you could merge it into the master branch.
We represent them in diagrams so you can visually see how the branch's are set up.
