When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	If you are working with many people, if you want backup or if you have multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You don't want git to accidently delete anything you are working on by 
	automatically downloading.
	Also the code you are working on might not work with the newest code 
	on the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	You fork someone elses work from a remote repository. You make a copy 
	for your own user. That way you can work on the "fork" from your 
	own repo and not need permission from the original owner
	to make commits.
	While a clone you just download someone's work. And simply only have
	it locally on your own machine. If you want to make changes
	you will have to get permission from the original owner.
	You can make a branch locally and remotely. If you want to test a 
	new feature you can branch it locally. Then you can push that
	branch to the remote without touching the master repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
